# Traffic Accident Severity Prediction and Visualization

The goal for our group was to predict and visualize traffic accidents within the continental USA. Please see the attached report and poster presentation for more information about this project!

Because of academic policies, the code and work can not be publicly posted. I am currently working on hosting the resulting tool on a dedicated website.

If you have any questions, or would like a live demo, do not hesitate to reach out!
